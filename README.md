ðŸš€ Project Completed: Customer Segmentation with RFM Analysis!



I worked with real transaction data and applied the RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) approach to understand customer behavior better. The idea was to answer simple but powerful questions:

 â€” How recently did a customer make a purchase?

 â€” How often do they buy?

 â€” How much do they spend?



By calculating these three metrics, I was able to group customers into meaningful segments â€” like loyal customers, at-risk customers, new customers, etc.

Throughout the project, I focused on:

 âœ… Cleaning and preparing the data using Python (Pandas, Numpy)

 âœ… Calculating RFM scores step by step

 âœ… Segmenting customers based on their behavior

 âœ… Visualizing the results using Matplotlib and Plotly

I really enjoyed this project because it made me think like a business owner â€” how to use data to make better decisions about customers. Plus, I got to practice my data cleaning, analysis, and visualization skills in a hands-on way.
